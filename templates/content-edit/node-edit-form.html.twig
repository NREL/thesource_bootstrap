/**
 * @file
 * Theme override for a node edit form.
 *
 * Overrides the Barrio two column template for the node add/edit form to remove the columns.
 *
 * NOTE: I tried to achieve this by changing the #theme in the form and by changing the theme
 * suggestion foir the hook, but was prevented from doing so by the fact that all alter functions
 * in the Barrio parent theme were executed after those in the NREL Bootstrap child them.
 *
 * This template will be used when a node edit form specifies 'node_edit_form'
 * as its #theme callback.  Otherwise, by default, node add/edit forms will be
 * themed by form.html.twig.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - form: The node add/edit form.
 *
 * @see seven_form_node_form_alter()
